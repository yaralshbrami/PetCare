  ##PetCare🐱
PetCare is a user interface design project The main goal of this project was to design clear, user-friendly, and accessible interfaces for an animal clinic system that allows pet owners to book appointments, view pet information, and order products easily.

🎯 Objective
The purpose of PetCare is to apply HCI principles in designing effective user interfaces — focusing on usability, simplicity, and user experience rather than system implementation.

🚀 Project Overview
PetCare provides a visual concept for how an animal clinic system could look and function. The design includes interfaces that allow:
* Creating and managing user accounts
* Booking appointments
* Viewing and editing pet information
* Browsing and ordering products
* Contacting the clinic easily
Each screen was designed with attention to clarity, consistency, and visual balance to ensure a positive experience for users.

👥 Target Users
* Pet Owners: Main users who register, manage pets, and make appointments.
* Veterinarians: View pet records and manage appointments.
* Receptionists: Handle scheduling and client communication.

🏁 Conclusion
PetCare demonstrates how thoughtful interface design, guided by HCI principles, can improve user experience even before implementation. The project emphasizes understanding users, designing intuitive interfaces, and evaluating design effectiveness.
